## Local Execution
To run the setup locally, you need to 

1. Start a postgres database
2. Start a MiniTwit application
3. Start a local test run

### 1. Start the postgres database
To start the postgres database take a look at the the [./database-setups/postgres/README.md](./database-setups/postgres/README.md)

### 2. Start a MiniTwit application
Navigate to the [./minitwit-implementations/](./minitwit-implementations/) folder and start one of the possible implementations

### 3. Init
This is work in progress

## Seeding the database
For some scenarios, the database needs to be pre-seeded, which can be done using the [seed.py](/database-seed/README.md) script. For instructions on running the script, see the corresponding [README.md](/database-seed/README.md).
