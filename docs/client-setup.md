# Client Setup
The clients are running Ubuntu Sevrer 24.10 and a setup script is provided in the [./scripts/client](../scripts/client/) folder. If it cannot run, first try to give it permission to run by running `chmod +x scripts/client/client-setup.sh`

Once the setup script has finished, the client can be started bu running the `client-run.sh` script also located in the [./scripts/client](../scripts/client/) folder.
